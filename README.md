=====================
Angular.js is primarily designed for dynamic data-driven applications, but there is still a market for AJAX-driven websites using CMS systems.

With that in mind, I created this Angular.js seed template that accesses a basic JSON-based API, and that deals with the following general website issues:

1. Dynamic routing (including specifying partials through the API feed)
2. Navigation building (including location-based feedback)
3. Breadcrumb building
4. Sitemap.xml building
5. SEO-friendly content, using the HASHBANG method

Nearly all the API-related seeds I have come across used technology that requires specialised hosting solutions (such as headless browsers to create Hashbang snapshots or node.js).
This seed, however, was created with the understanding that not everyone has either the knowledge or the access to such servers and technologies, so deals with everything using a standard scripting language (CFML).
